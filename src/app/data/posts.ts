    "contentHtml": "<p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has brought an urgent need for robust evaluation frameworks. As these models demonstrate increasingly sophisticated capabilities across vision and language tasks, the question of how to meaningfully measure their performance becomes paramount.</p>\n<h2>The Challenge of Comprehensive Evaluation</h2>\n<p>Traditional benchmarks, while useful for tracking progress, often fail to capture the nuanced capabilities that distinguish one model from another. A model might excel at visual question answering while struggling with spatial reasoning, or demonstrate strong performance on standard datasets while failing on adversarial examples.</p>\n<p>This suggests that our evaluation methodology needs to evolve alongside the models themselves. We need benchmarks that test not just accuracy, but also <strong>robustness</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, and the ability to handle edge cases gracefully.</p>\n<p>Consider the following dimensions of evaluation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Task diversity</strong> — covering visual QA, captioning, reasoning, grounding</li>\n<li><strong>Robustness testing</strong> — adversarial inputs, distribution shifts</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-lingual capability</strong> — performance across languages</li>\n<li><strong>Calibration</strong> — does the model know what it doesn&#39;t know?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Toward Better Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>Several principles should guide the development of next-generation evaluation suites:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Benchmarks should be <strong>diverse</strong> enough to cover the full spectrum of real-world use cases.</li>\n<li>They should include both automated metrics and human evaluation protocols.</li>\n<li>They should be designed to resist data contamination and memorization.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goal is not merely to rank models, but to understand their strengths and limitations in a way that guides both research and practical deployment decisions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A common aggregate metric is the weighted score across \\(k\\) tasks:</p>\n<div class=\"math-display\">\\[S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \\cdot \\text{score}_i, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1\\]</div>\n<p>For calibration, we measure the expected calibration error \\(\\text{ECE} = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\frac{|B_m|}{n} \\left| \\text{acc}(B_m) - \\text{conf}(B_m) \\right|\\) across \\(M\\) bins.</p>\n<p>A simple evaluation pipeline might look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block\"><div class=\"code-header\"><span class=\"code-lang\">python</span><button class=\"code-copy\" aria-label=\"Copy code\">Copy</button></div><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#24292e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#e1e4e8\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">def</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0\"> evaluate_model</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\">(model, benchmark):</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\">    results </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\"> {}</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">    for</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\"> task </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">in</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\"> benchmark.tasks:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\">        predictions </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\"> model.predict(task.inputs)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\">        results[task.name] </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\"> task.metric(predictions, task.targets)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583\">    return</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8\"> results</span></span></code></pre></div><h2>Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>As the field continues to mature, I believe we will see a shift toward more holistic evaluation frameworks that consider not just task performance, but also efficiency, fairness, and alignment with human values. The models we build are only as good as our ability to understand what they can and cannot do.</p>\n"

    "contentHtml": "<p>Reproducibility remains one of the most persistent challenges in machine learning research. Despite growing awareness of the problem, many published results remain difficult or impossible to reproduce. I want to share some thoughts on how better tooling can help address this gap.</p>\n<h2>The Reproducibility Gap</h2>\n<p>The gap between a paper&#39;s reported results and what an independent researcher can achieve often stems not from dishonesty, but from the sheer complexity of modern ML pipelines. Random seeds, hardware differences, library versions, data preprocessing choices, and dozens of other factors can all affect outcomes in subtle ways.</p>\n<p>What we need are tools that make it easy to <strong>capture and share</strong> these details automatically, rather than relying on researchers to document everything manually.</p>\n<p>A typical experiment involves many moving parts:</p>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\"><table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Examples</th><th>Impact on Reproducibility</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hardware</td><td>GPU model, memory</td><td>High</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Software</td><td>CUDA, PyTorch version</td><td>High</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Data</td><td>Preprocessing, splits</td><td>Critical</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Hyperparameters</td><td>LR, batch size, schedule</td><td>Critical</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Random state</td><td>Seeds, initialization</td><td>Medium</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>Principles of Good Research Tools</h2>\n<p>The best research tools share several qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are <strong>transparent</strong> about what they do</li>\n<li>They minimize configuration overhead</li>\n<li>They produce deterministic outputs wherever possible</li>\n<li>They integrate seamlessly into existing workflows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A tool that requires researchers to fundamentally change how they work will not be adopted, no matter how well-designed it is.

When code is open, it can be inspected, modified, and run by anyone.

    "description": "Why clarity in writing matters as much as the research itself.",
    "contentHtml": "<p>After years of reading and writing academic papers, I have come to believe that the quality of writing in a paper is nearly as important as the quality of the research it describes. A brilliant idea poorly communicated is, for all practical purposes, a lost idea.</p>\n<h2>Clarity Over Complexity</h2>\n<p>There is a persistent misconception in academia that complex prose signals sophisticated thinking. In reality, the opposite is often true. The deepest understanding of a subject enables the clearest explanation of it. When we struggle to write clearly about our work, it often reveals gaps in our own understanding.</p>\n<p>The best papers I have read share a common quality: they make difficult ideas feel <em>approachable</em> without sacrificing <em>precision</em>. This is extraordinarily hard to achieve, but it should be the standard we aspire to.</p>\n<p>As Strunk &amp; White put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Structure as Scaffolding</h2>\n<p>Good structure is invisible to the reader but essential to comprehension. Each section should flow naturally into the next, each paragraph should advance a single idea, and each sentence should earn its place.</p>\n<p>The academic paper format — with its introduction, related work, methodology, and results — provides a useful scaffold, but within that scaffold there is enormous room for craft.</p>\n<p>A well-structured paper follows a pattern:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hook</strong> the reader with a compelling problem statement</li>\n<li><strong>Contextualize</strong> within existing literature</li>\n<li><strong>Present</strong> the method with enough detail to reproduce</li>\n<li><strong>Demonstrate</strong> results with honest analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Discuss</strong> limitations and future directions</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Writing as Thinking</h2>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, writing is not merely the final step of research — it is itself a form of thinking. The act of putting ideas into words forces us to confront ambiguities, fill in logical gaps, and consider our work from the reader&#39;s perspective.</p>\n<p>Some of my best research insights have come not from experiments, but from the process of trying to explain my results clearly. In the words of Leslie Lamport:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you&#39;re thinking without writing, you only think you&#39;re thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"
